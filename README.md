## About

Welcome to my Spotify Clone project! This project is a demonstration of my skills in building interactive and engaging web applications using React. It mimics some of the key features of the popular music streaming platform, Spotify. By exploring the code and functionality of this project, you'll get a glimpse of my proficiency in front-end development and UI/UX design.

## Access Limitations

Due to the similarities to Spotify and the use of the Spotify Web API, this project operates in development mode. This means that only authorized users can access it. To facilitate evaluation by recruiters and potential contributors, I have provided test email addresses that can be used to log in and explore the project.

Please note that the project is not publicly accessible for all users due to these limitations set by the Spotify API.
